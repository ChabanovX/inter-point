# Linear Programming Solver using Interior-Point Algorithm

This project implements an Interior-Point algorithm to solve Linear Programming Problems (LPP). The solution follows the specifications outlined in Programming Task 2 for the Fall 2024 Introduction to Optimization course at Innopolis University.

## Project Overview
This project is a continuation from Programming Task 1, extending our previous LPP solution to the Interior-Point algorithm. This algorithm will be used to solve a general linear program defined by constraints and an objective function.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- No built-in optimization libraries (algorithm must be implemented from scratch).
- (Optional) Libraries for matrix manipulation, such as NumPy.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```
2. Install required libraries (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Program
Execute the main Python script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Input and Output Format

#### Input
1. **Objective Function Coefficients (C)**: A vector of coefficients.
2. **Constraint Matrix (A)**: A matrix representing the coefficients of constraints.
3. **Right-Hand Side Vector (b)**: A vector for the constraints' values.
4. **Starting Point**: Can be set manually or generated by the program.
5. **Accuracy (ϵ)**: The approximation accuracy for the iterative solution.
6. **Parameter α**: Set as `0.5` and compare with results for `α = 0.9`.

#### Output
- **String Responses**:
  - `"The method is not applicable!"` if the method does not apply.
  - `"The problem does not have a solution!"` if the problem is infeasible.
- **Solution Vector (x\*)**: The optimized decision variables by the Interior-Point algorithm.
- **Objective Function Value**: For both `α = 0.5` and `α = 0.9`.
- **Comparison with Simplex Method**: Includes results from Task 1 (Simplex Method).

## Testing
- The code is tested on different objective functions and constraint setups to ensure robust performance across varying LPP scenarios.
- You can add your test cases in the `tests` folder and execute them as follows:
  ```bash
  python tests/test_cases.py
  ```

## Comparison
This project also includes a comparison of results obtained by the Interior-Point algorithm with those achieved using the Simplex Method from Task 1.
